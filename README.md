# 📘 Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository contains my structured practice of **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**, focused on writing clean, efficient, and well-documented solutions.

The goal of this repository is to demonstrate **problem-solving skills, algorithmic thinking, and consistency** rather than just the number of problems solved.
